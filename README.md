# The Dimensions of Readiness
The framework of analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence rely on three major concepts:
   ```
    • Data: are collected from business environments/organizations and, through models, inform the design and improvement of intelligent decision processes and systems
    • Models: serve data-enabled languages that allow organizations to leverage data into the design of intelligent and improved decision processes and systems
    • Processes: comprise the sets of activities and resources organizations use to convert input to output
```
# The decision process includes:
    • Input: data, predictions, and decisions
    • Resources: databases, tools, and human experts
    • Activities: meetings, discussions, analyses, and algorithms
    • Output: actions

# Defining Models
A model:
```
    • Is a concept that captures relationships between different quantities in the real world.
    • Captures the relationship between the model's input that is usually observed and the output or outcome that can be either observed or unobserved
    • Has parameters that describe the relationship between the input and the output and they are estimated from data
```
In order for a business to have a holistic view of the market and how an organization competes efficiently within that market, it requires a robust analytic environment which includes:
   ```
    • Descriptive analytics: uses data aggregation and data mining to provide insight into the past and answer: “What has happened?”
    • Predictive analytics: uses statistical models and forecasting techniques to understand the future and answer: “What could happen?”
    • Prescriptive analytics: uses optimization and simulation algorithms to advise on possible outcomes and answer: “What should we do?”
```
Factors affecting the choice of models:
```
    • The accuracy of different models
    • The computational complexity
    • The amount of data needed to use each model
    • The interpretability of each model
```
# Qualitative and Quantitative models
The qualitative model
```
    • It is constituted by the concepts of clinical and logistical readiness
    • It does not provide exact equations that describe precise connections or relationships
    • It is called a descriptive model, as it describes the system and processes involved in your patient’s journey
    • It is an important first step but does not lend itself to the use of large-scale data
```
The data-enabled quantitative model
```
    • It takes the concept of readiness, both clinical and logistical readiness, and translate them to a model that is data-enabled
    • It is also known as a representation model
```
# Modeling Layers
The way you choose to interpret the data will become more nuanced over time. To understand these changes, you can use the following layers of modeling as a scale to guide organizations down the right path to get the most from their data.
```
    1. Data/signals
    2. Representation models
    3. Descriptive models
    4. Predictive models
    5. Prescriptive/optimization models
```
# Data and Models
The figure below shows the interaction between data and models. Based on the data, you can convert a qualitative model into a quantitative data-enabled model and finally into a predictive model. The predictions of the predictive models can be contrasted with the actual observations which will enable better decision making.
